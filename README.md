# ü§ñÔ∏è Jarvis - ChatGPT for Siri

Start the "Shortcut" through Siri to connect to the ChatGPT API, turning Siri into an AI chat assistant. You can speak your question directly to Siri, and Siri will answer you. Now our Siri has finally become intelligent and can talk to us fluently! And all this can be done with just a Shortcut and an API key.

# Preparation

- Ensure that the network can access the domain name https://api.openai.com.
- Ensure that there is enough balance in the API account: https://platform.openai.com/account/usage.
- Use Siri to start the shortcut: open Settings-> Siri Answer-> Automatic. Check "Always show what you say to Siri" to see if recognition is accurate. Ensure that Siri's language setting matches the language you are using.
- For versions 1.2 and above, you need to turn on the "Settings" - Apple ID - iCloud - iCloud Drive function to use the save to TXT file function.
